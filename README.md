# Project2    
I created a repository namaed Project2 and started on step one, typing in date, cal, pwd, and ls. Cal did not work for me so I was not able to see the calender. 
For step four I used nano task.sh instead of vi task.sh as instructed. Nano allowed me to open up and create new files to save in my repo. 
Step five was easy to do I just located a path to the executable binary using the which command. 
For step six I named the file as stated
Step seven I tried to execute the script, I am not sure where I went wrong but I belive it said permission declined.
Step eight was a bit difficult to figure out at first about relative vs absolute path. I wanted to have a full understanding of what I was doing so I went to another linux config link.(https://linuxconfig.org/filesystem-basics)
For step nine I created a hi world bash shell script with the chmod command. It was easy and straight foward.
Step 10 I backed up the file to the user home directory. This step took me awhile to figure out but with a lot of trial and error I made it work.
Step eleven I created some variables which are the essence of programming.I programmed the day and user.
Step twelve I did the input, output and error redirections.I took some time to understand the difference between stdout and stderr for redirecting output.
Step thirteen was functions that are used to organize and reuse code. I had some errors with finding the correct files but managed to still be able to continue without any consequences. 
Step fourteen was numeric and string comparisons. Using the echo $? command I checked for the return value. (0=True and 1=false)
Step fifteen was pretty intimidating with the conditional statements. It took some time to figure out how to initialize an integer variable and using an if/else conditional block.
Step sixteen was pretty easy using positional parameters.
Steps 17-17.3 was learning and doing the different types of loops. It did not go into as much detail as I would have liked so I did extra research to have a better understanding and more help with the step.
I found project two to be much harder and much more time consuming than project one but it was a good learning experience.
